// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "Determine what needs to be done: what are the inputs, what data needs to be stored, what needs to be output, ..."

const design = "Create a plan to implement the requirements. This can include a flow chart and specifying the languages/technologies to use for each step."

const implementation = 'Code up the "design" in whatever stack(s) will be used.'

const testingAndIntegration = `Test the code developed in "implementation" to make sure it operates correctly: doesn't crash, gets the appropriate input, provides correct output, and/or stores the correct data). Deploy the code to the live environment.`

const maintain = `Maintain the code going forward: fix bugs because the implementation didn't account for certain "odd" input, make changes due to OS changes/requirements, add additional features.`
